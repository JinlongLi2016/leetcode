# 115 不同字序列

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return *the number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t*.

A string's **subsequence** is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions. (i.e., `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

It is guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.



字串（subsequences）



* mine

```python
class Solution:
    def numDistinct(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        m, n = len(s), len(t)
        state = [0] * (n+1)
        state[0] = 1 
        for i in range(1, m+1):
            for j in range(n, 0, -1):
                if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:
                    state[j] += state[j-1]
        return state[n]
```



动态规划：`f[i,j] `为`S[:i] `子序列包含T[:j]的数量， 转换方程为`f[i,j] = f[i-1,j]  + (f[i-1,j-1] if s[i] == t[j])`

注意边角情况，f[0,0]怎么处理？
