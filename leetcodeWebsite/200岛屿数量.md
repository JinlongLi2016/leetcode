# 200岛屿数量

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        def dfs(i, j, flag):
            if 0 <= i< m and 0<= j < n:
                if grid[i][j] == "1":
                    grid[i][j] = flag
                    dfs(i-1, j, flag)
                    dfs(i+1, j, flag)
                    dfs(i, j-1, flag)
                    dfs(i, j+1, flag)
        cnt = 2
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == "1":
                    dfs(i, j, cnt)
                    cnt += 1
        return cnt - 2
