# 202快乐数

Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

Return `true` *if* `n` *is a happy number, and* `false` *if not*.

* M1

```python
def get_next(n):
    res = 0
    while n > 0:
        res += (n%10)**2
        n = n // 10
    return res

class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        state = set()
        
        while n not in state:
            state.add(n)
            n = get_next(n)
            if n == 1:
                return True
        return False
    	
        # 另外一种while循环
    	while n != 1 and n not in state:
            state.add(n)
            n = get_next(n)
        return n == 1
```

需要用case来测试一下代码的各个分支是否Okay
