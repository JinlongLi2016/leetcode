# 109 转换有序链表为BST

Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are **sorted in ascending order**, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of *every* node never differ by more than 1.

* mine：寻找到中间节点的前一个节点，将中间节点作为根节点，左右两侧单链表分别构造

```python
class Solution:
    def sortedListToBST(self, head: ListNode) -> TreeNode:
        if not head:
            return None
        dummy = ListNode(next=head)
        p = q = dummy
        while q.next and q.next.next:
            p = p.next
            q = q.next.next
        t = TreeNode(p.next.val)
        if p.next is head: # 1个元素时会产生无限递归
            return t
        
        t.right = self.sortedListToBST(p.next.next)
        p.next = None
        t.left = self.sortedListToBST(head)
        return t
```
