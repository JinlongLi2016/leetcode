# 198抢劫房

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.

dp[i] : 表示如果偷i家，则上一家应该偷哪一家？（应该尽可能地偷，所有可以偷i-2家。但是偷i-2家的时候 i - 3家是不能偷的。因此为了使得前面的价值最大，应该选择max(i-2, i - 3)）

```python
class Solution:
    def rob_raw(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        if n <= 2:
            return max(nums)
        dp = [0] * n
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        dp[1] = nums[1]
        dp[2] = nums[2] + dp[0]
        for i in range(3, n):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-3], dp[i-2] ) + nums[i]
        return max(dp[n-1], dp[n-2])
    
    # refine for better, from leetcode-discuss
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        included  = excluded = 0
        for n in nums:
            i, e = included, excluded
            included = excluded + n
            excluded = max(i, e)
        return max(included, excluded)
