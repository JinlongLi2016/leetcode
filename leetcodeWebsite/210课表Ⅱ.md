# 210课表Ⅱ

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return *the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses*. If there are many valid answers, return **any** of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return **an empty array**.

    def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        cs = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        for a, b in prerequisites:
            cs[a] += b,
        popout = [False] * numCourses
        cnt = numCourses
