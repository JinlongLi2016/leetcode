# 213抢劫房Ⅱ

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.



* M1：

```PYTHON
def helper(nums, start, end_excluded):
    included, excluded = 0, 0
    for i in range(start, end_excluded):
        i, e = included, excluded
        included = e + nums[i]
        excluded = max(i, e)
     return max(included, excluded)

def robⅡ(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n <= 2:
        return max(nums)
   	return max(helper(nums, 0, n - 1), 
              helper(nums, 1, n))
```
