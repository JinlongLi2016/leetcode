# 106中序后序序列构建二叉树



```python
class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, inorder: List[int], postorder: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        if not inorder:
            return None
        #if len(inorder) == 1:
        #    return TreeNode(val=inorder[0])
        split_idx = inorder.index(postorder[-1])
        return TreeNode(val = postorder[-1],
                    left = self.buildTree(inorder[:split_idx], postorder[:split_idx]),
                    right = self.buildTree(inorder[split_idx+1:], postorder[split_idx:-1]))
```

LeetCode 提供了一些分析

```
The code is clean and short. However, if you give this implementation during an interview, there is a good chance you will be asked, "can you improve/optimize your solution?"

Why? Take a look at Line A, Line B and Line C.
Line A takes O(N) time.
Line B and C takes O(N) time and extra space.
Thus, the overall running time and extra space is O(N^2).
So this implementation has a very bad performance, and you can avoid it.

如何优化上述代码？迭代可以吗？
