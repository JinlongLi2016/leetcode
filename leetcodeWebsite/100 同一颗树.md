# 100 同一颗树

Given the roots of two binary trees `p` and `q`, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

* Mine

```python
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if p is None and q is None:
            return True
        elif p is notNone and q is not None:
            return p.val == q.val and self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
        else:
            return False
```

判断的方式可以更简单一点

```python
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if p is None or q is None:
            return p == q
        else:
            return p.val == q.val and self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
```
