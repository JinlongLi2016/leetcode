# 222完全二叉树节点计数

Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to **[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.



* 通过分析左右子树的高度关系确定哪一部分是满的
* 再借由"一个高度为h满二叉树的节点数量是$2^h - 1$"计算出总数
