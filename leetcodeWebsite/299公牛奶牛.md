You are playing the **[Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)** game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:

- The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
- The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.

Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return *the hint for your friend's guess*.

The hint should be formatted as `"xAyB"`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.

**constraints:**

- `1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000`
- `secret.length == guess.length`
- `secret` and `guess` consist of digits only.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def getHint(self, secret: str, guess: str) -> str:
        sec_left, gus_left = defaultdict(int), defaultdict(int)
        a = b = 0
        for s, g in zip(secret, guess):
            if s == g:
                a += 1
            else:
                sec_left[s] += 1
                gus_left[g] += 1
        for n in range(10):
            b += min(sec_left[str(n)], gus_left[str(n)])
        return str(a) + 'A' + str(b) + 'B'
```



* LC: [One pass Java solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulls-and-cows/discuss/74621/One-pass-Java-solution)

```java
public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
    int bulls = 0;
    int cows = 0;
    int[] numbers = new int[10];
    for (int i = 0; i<secret.length(); i++) {
        int s = Character.getNumericValue(secret.charAt(i));
        int g = Character.getNumericValue(guess.charAt(i));
        if (s == g) bulls++;
        else {
            if (numbers[s] < 0) cows++;
            if (numbers[g] > 0) cows++;
            numbers[s] ++;
            numbers[g] --;
        }
    }
    return bulls + "A" + cows + "B";
}
```



s中的数字+；g中的数字-；

```

nums[s] < 0: 表明s这个字母在guess中出现次数高于secret中出现次数
	此时，secret中出现这个次数，那么在之前肯定有与之匹配的字母
nums[s] > 0: 表明s这个字母在guess中出现次数低于secret中出现次数

```
