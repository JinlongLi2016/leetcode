# 080 排序数组移除重复元素Ⅱ

Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

Return `k` *after placing the final result in the first* `k` *slots of* `nums`.

Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** with O(1) extra memory.

* My Solution: 依次对每个元素计数，如果大于2则只放置两个

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:  
        k = i = j = 0
        while j < len(nums):
            cnt = 0
            i = j
            while j < len(nums) and nums[i] == nums[j]:
                cnt += 1
                j += 1
            cnt = min(2, cnt)
            p = nums[i]
            for _ in range(cnt):
                nums[k] = p
                k += 1
        return k
```
