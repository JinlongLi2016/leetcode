# 275H指数Ⅱ

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper and `citations` is sorted in an **ascending order**, return compute the researcher's `h`**-index**.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n − h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`**-index**.

You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```



* M1：H-index:至少有h篇文章引用大于H，因此就是寻找最大的 idx，使得 idx 处的引用数不低于右侧的文章数量（最好是等于），且idx应该尽可能的大。

  因此问题转换为二分查找满足要求的索引，并返回该索引处右侧的文章数量。

```python
# H-index:至少有h篇文章引用大于H
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(citations)
        low, high = 0, n - 1
        while low < high:
            m = low + (high - low) // 2
            if citations[m] < n - m: # 右侧有n-m篇文章, m included
            # 当m处的引用数量过少时，说明右侧有更多的高引用文章
                low = m + 1
            else:
            # m处的引用很多，大过了右侧的文章的数量。
                high = m
        return 0 if  citations[low]==0 else n - low
if __name__=="__main__":
    s = Solution()
    print(s.hIndex([1, 2, 100]))
```

考虑到corner case: **[0]**
