# 64路径最小耗费

Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.



* 6mins: 计算从左侧还是上侧下来的耗费小一些
```python
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        lst = [grid[0][0]]
        for v in grid[0][1:]:
            lst += (lst[-1] + v),
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(n):
                if j == 0:
                    lst[j] += grid[i][j]
                else:
                    lst[j] = min(lst[j-1], lst[j]) + grid[i][j]
        return lst[-1]
```
