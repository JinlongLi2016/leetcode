# 048旋转图像

You are given an `n x n` 2D `matrix` representing an image, rotate the image by **90** degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.



* M1: 重点是**图像转置**。转置之后再翻转达到目的（或者处理顺序反过来）。

  * `A[:] = zip(*A[::-1])`  or `A[:] = map(list, zip(*A[::-1]))`

    [::-1] to flip image up-side down

    zip() to transpose image
