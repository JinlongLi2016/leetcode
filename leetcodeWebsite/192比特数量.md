Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Note:**

- Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.
- In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using [2's complement notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement). Therefore, in **Example 3**, the input represents the signed integer. `-3`.

* ##### [C++ Solution: n & (n - 1)](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/discuss/55255/C%2B%2B-Solution%3A-n-and-(n-1))

```python
int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
    int count = 0;
    
    while (n) {
        n &= (n - 1);
        count++;
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

<u>n & (n - 1) drops the lowest set bit. It's a neat little bit trick.</u>



Let's use n = 00101100 as an example. This binary representation has three 1s.



If n = 00101100, then n - 1 = 00101011, so n & (n - 1) = 00101100 & 00101011 = 00101000. Count = 1.



If n = 00101000, then n - 1 = 00100111, so n & (n - 1) = 00101000 & 00100111 = 00100000. Count = 2.



If n = 00100000, then n - 1 = 00011111, so n & (n - 1) = 00100000 & 00011111 = 00000000. Count = 3.



n is now zero, so the while loop ends, and the final count (the numbers of set bits) is returned.
