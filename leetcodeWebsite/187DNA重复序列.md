# 187DNA重复序列

The **DNA sequence** is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.

- For example, `"ACGAATTCCG"` is a **DNA sequence**.

When studying **DNA**, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string `s` that represents a **DNA sequence**, return all the **10-letter-long** sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in **any order**.

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def findRepeatedDnaSequences(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        d = defaultdict(int)
        for i in range(len(s) - 9):
            d[s[i:i+10]] += 1
        ret = [k for k, v in d.items() if v > 1]
        return ret
```
