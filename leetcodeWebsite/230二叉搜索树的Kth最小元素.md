# 230二叉搜索树的Kth最小元素

Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return *the* `kth` (**1-indexed**) *smallest element in the tree*.

**Follow up:** If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize? 



* M1,中序遍历逐个排除

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: TreeNode, k: int) -> int:
        cnt = 0
        res = None
        def inOrder(r):
            nonlocal cnt, res
            if (not r) or ( cnt > k) :
                return
            inOrder(r.left)
            cnt += 1
            if cnt == k:
                res = r.val
            inOrder(r.right)
        inOrder(root)
        return res
```

通过在节点上面附加一个属性N，用以记录该子树的节点数量。
