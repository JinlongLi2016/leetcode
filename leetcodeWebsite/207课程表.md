# 207课程表

There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

- For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

拓扑排序

```
G(V, E)
while
```

* M1: 拓扑排序,构建一个课程依赖映射，每个课程依赖于一系列课程。

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        cs = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        for a, b in prerequisites:
            cs[a] += b, # 列表中存储课程a之前必须学习的课程
        popout = [False] * numCourses
        cnt = numCourses
        while cnt:
            for i, c in enumerate(cs):
                if not popout[i] and not c:
                    cnt -= 1
                    popout[i] = True
                    break
            else:
                break
            t = i
            for i, c in enumerate(cs):
                if not popout[i] and t in c:
                    c.remove(t)
        return not cnt
```

拓扑排序的时间复杂度是$O(n^3)$?采用DFS算法的速度更快？

* M2: dfs

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        cs = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        for a, b in prerequisites:
            cs[a] += b,
```
