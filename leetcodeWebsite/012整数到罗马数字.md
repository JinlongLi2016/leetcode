# 012整数到罗马数字

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral.

* mine

```python
d = {
    1000: 'M',
    500: 'D',
    100: 'C',
    50: 'L',
    10: 'X',
    5: 'V',
    1: 'I',
}
def what_char(n, u):
    if n == 4:
        return d[u] + d[u*5]
    if n == 9:
        return d[u] + d[10 * u]
    prefix = ''
    if n >= 5:
        prefix = d[u*5]
        n -= 5
    return prefix + d[u]*int(n)

class Solution:
    def intToRoman(self, num: int) -> str:
        res = []
        unite = 1000
        while num > 0:
            res.append(what_char(num // unite, unite))
            num %= unite
            unite /= 10
        return ''.join(res)
```
