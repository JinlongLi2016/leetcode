# 114 二叉树转为链表

Given the `root` of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

- The "linked list" should use the same `TreeNode` class where the `right` child pointer points to the next node in the list and the `left` child pointer is always `null`.
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a [**pre-order** **traversal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order,_NLR) of the binary tree.

* mine: `helper`函数的功能是把树t转为满足要求的链表，内部有终止条件，以及将左右两个分支处理、整合的步骤。

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
def helper(t):
    if not t:
        return t
    left = helper(t.left)
    right = helper(t.right)
    pre = t
    while left:
        tmp = left.right
        left.right = pre.right
        pre.right = left
        pre.left = None
        pre = pre.right
        left = tmp
    pre.right = right
    return t
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, root: TreeNode) -> None:
        helper(root)
```

  Very Insightful, brilliant

  ```java
  private TreeNode prev = null;
  
  public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
      if (root == null)
          return;
      flatten(root.right);
      flatten(root.left);
      root.right = prev;
      root.left = null;
      prev = root;
  }
  ```

  Great solution of the `post order traversal` in `(right, left, root)` order!
  Basically, the traversing order after flattening is `pre order traversal` in `(root, left, right)`, like

  

  ```
  1
   \
    2
     \
      3
       \
        4
         \
          5
           \
            6
  ```

  

  from the original tree:

  

  ```
      1
     / \
    2   5
   / \   \
  3   4   6
  ```

  

  If we traverse the flattened tree in the reverse way, we would notice that `[6->5->4->3->2->1]` is in `(right, left, root)` order of the original tree. So the reverse order after flattening is `post order traversal` in `(right, left, root)` order like `[6->5->4->3->2->1]`.

  

  The idea is to traverse the original tree in this order by

  

  ```
  public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
      if (root == null)
          return;
      flatten(root.right);
      flatten(root.left);
  }
  ```

  

  and then set each node's right pointer as the previous one in `[6->5->4->3->2->1]`, as such the right pointer behaves similar to a link in the flattened tree(though technically, it's still a right child reference from the tree data structure's perspective) and set the left child as null before the end of one recursion by

  

  ```
  private TreeNode prev = null;
  
  public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
      if (root == null)
          return;
      flatten(root.right);
      flatten(root.left);
      root.right = prev;
      root.left = null;
      prev = root;
  }
  ```
